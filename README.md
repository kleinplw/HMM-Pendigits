# Hidden Markov Model digit classification from pen-data

This project features 3 different ways of performing the classification using a HMM.
* Using continuous 2D data directly -> Gaussian HMM
* Using 1D projection with K-MEANS -> MultiNomial HMM
* Using 1D projection with drawing direction -> Multinomial HMM
